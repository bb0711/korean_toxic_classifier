# korean_toxic_classifier

This korean toxic classifier uses fasttext and TextCNN model for classifing korean toxic comments. We collected the korean comments from Naver Movie Review comments and labeled them as toxic or not by using crowdsourcing. For the crowdsourcing, since there weren't any useful crowdsourcing platform for us, so we designed easy crowdsourcing web for labeling the data. We tried to compare the method of constructing korean word vector by jamo-level(자모음 단위) and syllable-level(글자 단위).
